Regression testing for text4ht code.

* Needs
 - testing .4ht files
 - testing .htf fonts
 - testing tex4ht driver/processor
 - testing t4ht postprocessor
 - 1 test file -> n processors (htlatex, xhlatex, dblatex) -> n different outputs.
 - configuration per single file, per folder(project), global
 - test unit test, - as big as necessary, minimal as possible.
 - test 1 big file, - many generated files.


* Output
 - single html + css + images
 - multiple html + css + images
 - xhtml, etc.
 
* Aproach 1. Checking output files

* Aproach 2. Checking log files
    If html files (generated vs pre-saved) are the same, so the log files should be.

** Advantages:
   - resolves multiple output checking: html, css, images.
** Disadvantages
   - log file not very human readable


* l3build aproach
  - test log files
  - test file should be minimal
  - normalisation of log file
  - test different engines vs the same (pre-saved) log.
    This is possible due normalisation. (Not possible in tex4ht as outputs of html,
    xhtml(tei), xhtml(docbook) is different)
 - automated testing (without manual intervention)
 - result of test file is manually verified  and stored as a certified result.
 - system should be portable (does not necessarily apply to tex4ht, - for now just linux)
 - create CTAN package
 - process DTX files (to get .sty, .cls)
