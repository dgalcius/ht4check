Regression testing for text4ht code.

* Needs
 - testing .4ht files
 - testing .htf fonts
 - testing tex4ht driver/processor
 - testing t4ht postprocessor
 - 1 test file -> n processors (htlatex, xhlatex, dblatex) -> n different outputs.
 - configuration per single file, per folder(project), global


* Output
 - single html + css + images
 - multiple html + css + images
 - xhtml, etc.
 
* Aproach 1. Checking output files

* Aproach 2. Checking log files
    If html files (generated vs pre-saved) are the same, so the log files should be.

** Advantages:
   - resolves multiple output checking: html, css, images.
** Disadvantages
   - log file not very human readable
